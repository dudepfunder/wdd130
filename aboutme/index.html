    <h2>Aidan Pfunder</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Aidan. I am a student at Brigham Young University Idaho studying Accounting. My favorite thing about BYU-Idaho is the weather. I am from Arizona where it is very hot and miserable. I work for the school fixing printers all over campus.</p>
    <p>When I was younger my dad payed for mine and my 3 siblings' braces just by making a website for our orthodontist. I know that making websites is a useful tool that I will use many times throughout my life and career</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ my whole life and I served my mission in North Georgia. There are very large cockroaches in Georgia.</p>
